Pacific is a free rsa encryption service. The website is made with node js, and the front end is ejs/html. The encryption is achieved using a written from scratch rsa algorithm (python).

## The algorithm
The encryption algorithm will be described here when I get not-lazy.

Edit: I didn't get un-lazy, google "assymetric rsa encryption explanation".
